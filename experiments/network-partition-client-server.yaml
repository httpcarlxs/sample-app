# Experiment: One-way network partition from flask-client to flask-server
# Description: Simulates a unidirectional network partition where traffic from flask-client to flask-server is blocked for 60 seconds.
# Expected Effect: Clients will not be able to reach the server, causing requests to fail or timeout, while responses from the server are unaffected.
