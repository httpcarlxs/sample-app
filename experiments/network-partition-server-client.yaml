# Experiment: One-way network partition from flask-server to flask-client
# Description: Simulates a unidirectional network partition where traffic from flask-server to flask-client is blocked for 60 seconds.
# Expected Effect: Server responses will not reach the client, leading to client-side timeouts or errors, while client requests are still received by the server.
