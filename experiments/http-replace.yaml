# Experiment: HTTP Response Delay Violation
# Description: Simulates response manipulation by delaying HTTP responses by 2 seconds and replacing the body with a fixed JSON payload for all requests to port 5000 on flask-client.
# Expected Effect: The client receives delayed and modified responses, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or UI inconsistencies.
