# Experiment: Network partition between flask-server and flask-client (both directions)
# Description: Simulates a network partition isolating all flask-server pods from all flask-client pods in both directions for 60 seconds.
# Expected Effect: Communication between the client and server will be completely blocked, preventing any request or response exchange.
