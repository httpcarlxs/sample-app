# Experiment: Total network isolation of all CAS pods.
# Description: This experiment partitions all CAS pods from the rest of the network, effectively simulating a total network outage.
# Expected Effect: All operations that rely on communication with the CAS should fail during the 120s duration of the chaos.

#Obs: Not working. Operations continue to function as if the experiment had not been applied
