# Experiment: Network isolation between the CAS and all LAS pods
# Descrition: Simulate the unavailibility of the attestation service (LAS) for the CAS
# Expected effect: CAS will be unable to perform operations requiring communication with LAS, such as attesting new clients.

#Obs: Not working. Operations continue to function as if the experiment had not been applied
